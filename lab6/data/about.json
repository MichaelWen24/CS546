    "biography": "I was born at 3/18/1994. Before I was 9 years old, I lived at a small village with my grandparents. After that, I went to Kunming with my mother, and it became my new home. By the way, it is a really beautiful city, it's also called spring city which means any season in the city is spring. \n I am a graduate student of Stevens. I chose Computer Science as my major during bachelor studying, beacuse I am really interested in this field. However, after I came to USA and began my master studying, I found out the life is not as same as I expected. The studying life is really rough. Feelsbadman.",
