    "story": "On the March of this year, I bought a Samsung S9+ to myself for the birthday gift. Actually I bought it bacause my idol is the spokesman of Samsung Espanol. \nHowever, as a long time iOS user, I found out that the Andriod system is not suit to me. Without iCloud, everything became really uncomfortable. It feels like you lose something and you don't want to do anything with this phone, even though the camera system is really really good. So I decided to use it until the announcement of next generation iPhone. \nI guess I will not buy something without thinking, well, who knows. And I just bought a monitor for coding last day, cause my laptop screen is so small. \nXD "
